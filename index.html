      <h3>Money Jar</h3>
      <p>This is my Money Jar web Application. It was my Senior Project. It is a virtual jar, Users can create a virtual Jar on their account and invite others to join it. Total value of the jar can be increased as desired by all participants. </p>
      <p>Money jar is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was built using a PostgresSQL database and in VsCode</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, this page is meant to be veiwed via mobile only. Money Jar was a solo project, built in about 40 hours over the course of 2 months. I hope to improve it as I get the time. Fix the many bugs, and work with a designer to make it look better.</p>

      <h3>DnD Initative Tracker</h3>
      <p>This is my Initiative Tracker application. I built it during a web engineering class at BYU-I. We were required to switch tasks, but with more time I would love to link it to a database, and fix the bugs.</p>
      <p>The tracker allows users to submit characters to a database, and then retrieve them later. A user will use the Roster system to add players for a game encounter and the system will order and track this game</p>
      <p>This project was also a solo project, built over about a month. It uses the same systems as Money Jar, using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was built using a PostgresSQL database and in VsCode</p>
